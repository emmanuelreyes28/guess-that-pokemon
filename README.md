## Guess that Pok√©mon!

Guess that Pok√©mon is a fun guessing game that brings you back to your childhood. Enter your name and the number of rounds you would like to play. Try guessing the pokemon silhouette shown and shoot for a perfect score!

## How It Was Built

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

## What I Learned

This project helped me solidify my skills making working with third party APIs, creating reusable functional components and working with Next.js framework.

## How Can I Make It Better?

- Introduce an advanced difficulty where users can enter a free text response.
- Show player pokemons guessed correctly and incorrectly at the end of each session.
